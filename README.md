<div align="center">

🦉 OWL is a cutting-edge framework for multi-agent collaboration that pushes the boundaries of task automation, built on top of the [CAMEL-AI Framework](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel).

<!-- OWL achieves **58.18** average score on [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) benchmark and ranks 🏅️ #1 among open-source frameworks. -->

Our vision is to revolutionize how AI agents collaborate to solve real-world tasks. By leveraging dynamic agent interactions, OWL enables more natural, efficient, and robust task automation across diverse domains.

# 🔥 News

- **[2025.03.07]**: We open-source the codebase of 🦉 OWL project.

# 🎬 Demo Video

https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/55657767/420211368-f29f477d-7eef-46da-8d7a-8f3bcf506da2.mp4

# ✨️ Core Features

- **Real-time Information Retrieval**: Leverage Wikipedia, Google Search, and other online sources for up-to-date information.
- **Multimodal Processing**: Support for handling internet or local videos, images, and audio data.
- **Browser Automation**: Utilize the Playwright framework for simulating browser interactions, including scrolling, clicking, input handling, downloading, navigation, and more.
- **Document Parsing**: Extract content from Word, Excel, PDF, and PowerPoint files, converting them into text or Markdown format.
- **Code Execution**: Write and execute Python code using interpreter.

# 🛠️ Installation

## **Clone the Github repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git
cd owl
```

## **Set up Environment**

Using Conda (recommended):
```bash
conda create -n owl python=3.11
conda activate owl
```

Using venv (alternative):
```bash
python -m venv owl_env
# On Windows
owl_env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source owl_env/bin/activate
```


## **Install Dependencies**

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

## **Setup Environment Variables** 

In the `owl/.env_template` file, you will find all the necessary API keys along with the websites where you can register for each service. To use these API services, follow these steps:

1. *Copy and Rename*: Duplicate the `.env_example` file and rename the copy to `.env`.
2. *Fill in Your Keys*: Open the `.env` file and insert your API keys in the corresponding fields. 
3. *For using more other models*: please refer to our CAMEL models docs:https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/models.html#supported-model-platforms-in-camel


> **Note**: For optimal performance, we strongly recommend using OpenAI models. Our experiments show that other models may result in significantly lower performance on complex tasks and benchmarks.

# 🚀 Quick Start
   
Run the following minimal example:

```bash
python owl/run.py
```
You can run OWL agent with your own task by modifying the `run.py` script:

```python
# Define your own task
question = "Task description here."

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)

logger.success(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

Example tasks you can try:
- "Find the latest stock price for Apple Inc."
- "Analyze the sentiment of recent tweets about climate change"
- "Help me debug this Python code: [your code here]"
- "Summarize the main points from this research paper: [paper URL]"

# 🧪 Experiments

We provided a script to reproduce the results on GAIA. 
You can check the `run_gaia_roleplaying.py` file and run the following command:

```bash
python run_gaia_roleplaying.py
```

# ⏱️ Future Plans

- [ ] Write a technical blog post detailing our exploration and insights in multi-agent collaboration in real-world tasks.
- [ ] Enhance the toolkit ecosystem with more specialized tools for domain-specific tasks.
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated agent interaction patterns and communication protocols

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is my Chrome browser showing a blank screen even though there's output in the console?**

A: This is expected behavior. When OWL determines that a task can be completed using non-browser tools (like search, code analysis, etc.), the browser window may remain blank. The browser is only activated when web interaction is necessary. We plan to implement lazy loading in future updates to improve this user experience.
