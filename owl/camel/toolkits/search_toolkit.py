            Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your search results:
            - When dealing with web snippets, keep in mind that they are often brief and lack specific details. If the snippet doesn't provide useful information, but the URL is from a highly-ranked source, it might still contain the data you need. 
            - For more detailed answers, you should utilize other tools to analyze the content of the websites in the search results, e.g. document relevant toolkit.
            - When seeking specific quantities, it's essential to look for a reliable and accurate source. Avoid relying solely on web snippets for figures like dollar amounts, as they may be imprecise or approximated.
            - If the information found in the snippets doesn't answer your original query satisfactorily, make sure to check the first URL. This is likely to contain much more in-depth content, as it's ranked as the most relevant. 
            - Additionally, when looking for books, consider searching for publicly available full-text PDFs, which can be searched entirely at once using document tools for relevant content.

        See https://api.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/query
        for more details.

        Args:
            q (str): The user's search query term. Query cannot be empty.
                Maximum of 400 characters and 50 words in the query.
            country (str): The search query country where results come from.
                The country string is limited to 2 character country codes of
                supported countries. For a list of supported values, see
                Country Codes. (default::obj:`US `)
            search_lang (str): The search language preference. The 2 or more
                character language code for which search results are provided.
                For a list of possible values, see Language Codes.
            ui_lang (str): User interface language preferred in response.
                Usually of the format '<language_code>-<country_code>'. For
                more, see RFC 9110. For a list of supported values, see UI
                Language Codes.
            count (int): The number of search results returned in response.
                The maximum is 20. The actual number delivered may be less than
                requested. Combine this parameter with offset to paginate
                search results.
            offset (int): The zero based offset that indicates number of search
                results per page (count) to skip before returning the result.
                The maximum is 9. The actual number delivered may be less than
                requested based on the query. In order to paginate results use
                this parameter together with count. For example, if your user
                interface displays 20 search results per page, set count to 20
                and offset to 0 to show the first page of results. To get
                subsequent pages, increment offset by 1 (e.g. 0, 1, 2). The
                results may overlap across multiple pages.
            safesearch (str): Filters search results for adult content.
                The following values are supported:
                - 'off': No filtering is done.
                - 'moderate': Filters explicit content, like images and videos,
                    but allows adult domains in the search results.
                - 'strict': Drops all adult content from search results.
            freshness (Optional[str]): Filters search results by when they were
                discovered:
                - 'pd': Discovered within the last 24 hours.
                - 'pw': Discovered within the last 7 Days.
                - 'pm': Discovered within the last 31 Days.
                - 'py': Discovered within the last 365 Days.
                - 'YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD': Timeframe is also supported by
                    specifying the date range e.g. '2022-04-01to2022-07-30'.
            text_decorations (bool): Whether display strings (e.g. result
                snippets) should include decoration markers (e.g. highlighting
                characters).
            spellcheck (bool): Whether to spellcheck provided query. If the
                spellchecker is enabled, the modified query is always used for
                search. The modified query can be found in altered key from the
                query response model.
            result_filter (Optional[str]): A comma delimited string of result
                types to include in the search response. Not specifying this
                parameter will return back all result types in search response
                where data is available and a plan with the corresponding
                option is subscribed. The response always includes query and
                type to identify any query modifications and response type
                respectively. Available result filter values are:
                - 'discussions'
                - 'faq'
                - 'infobox'

                - 'web'
                - 'locations'
            goggles_id (Optional[str]): Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on
                top of Brave's search index. For more details, refer to the
                Goggles repository.
            units (Optional[str]): The measurement units. If not provided,
                units are derived from search country. Possible values are:
                - 'metric': The standardized measurement system
                - 'imperial': The British Imperial system of units.
            extra_snippets (Optional[bool]): A snippet is an excerpt from a
                page you get as a result of the query, and extra_snippets
                allow you to get up to 5 additional, alternative excerpts. Only
                available under Free AI, Base AI, Pro AI, Base Data, Pro Data
                and Custom plans.
            summary (Optional[bool]): This parameter enables summary key
                generation in web search results. This is required for
                summarizer to be enabled.

Please act as a search agent, constructing appropriate keywords and searach terms, using search toolkit to collect relevant information, including urls, webpage snapshots, etc.
Here are some tips that help you perform web search:
- Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit.
- If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding official sources rather than direct answers.
  For example, as for the question "What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?", your first search term must be coarse-grained like "National Geographic YouTube" to find the youtube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more urls.
- The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question, you only need to collect relevant information.

Here are the question: {question}

Please perform web search and return the listed search result, including urls and necessary webpage snapshots, introductions, etc.
